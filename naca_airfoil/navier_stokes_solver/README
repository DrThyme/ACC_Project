This program solves incompressible flow past wing profile.

To run the code do
./airfoil num_samples visc speed T mesh.xml

For example if you want to save 10 samples, run with the viscosity
of nu=0.0001 and speed of v=10.0, total time is T=1, and
the mesh is in "cloudnaca/msh/r1a18n200.xml" do

./airfoil  10 0.0001 10. 1 cloudnaca/msh/r1a18n200.xml

The output is inside results folder. It contains two
set of vtk files for velocity and pressure, and one
data file with drag and lift forces stored
in every time-step
